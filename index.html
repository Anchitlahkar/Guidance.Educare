                                Machine learning is the branch of artificial intelligence, which deals with systems and
                                algorithms that can learn any new data and data patterns.

                                Machine learning includes a section of machine learning and deep learning is a part of
                                machine learning. The ability of program which follows machine learning concepts is to
                                improve its performance of observed data. The main motive of data transformation is to
                                improve its knowledge in order to achieve better results in the future, provide output
                                closer to the desired output for that particular system. Machine learning includes
                                “pattern recognition” which includes the ability to recognize the patterns in data.

                                The patterns should be trained to show the output in desirable manner.

                                Supervised learning or supervised training includes a procedure where the training set
                                is given as input to the system wherein, each example is labeled with a desired output
                                value. The training in this type is performed using minimization of a particular loss
                                function, which represents the output error with respect to the desired output system.

                                In unsupervised learning or unsupervised training, include training examples, which are
                                not labeled by the system to which class they belong. The system looks for the data,
                                which share common characteristics, and changes them based on internal knowledge
                                features.This type of learning algorithms are basically used in clustering problems.

                </div>
                <p><em>
                        The history of Artificial Intelligence (AI) began in antiquity, with myths, stories and rumors
                        of artificial beings endowed with intelligence or consciousness by master craftsmen. The seeds
                        of modern AI were planted by classical philosophers who attempted to describe the process of
                        human thinking as the mechanical manipulation of symbols. This work culminated in the invention
                        of the programmable digital computer in the 1940s, a machine based on the abstract essence of
                        mathematical reasoning. This device and the ideas behind it inspired a handful of scientists to
                        begin seriously discussing the possibility of building an electronic brain.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The field of AI research was founded at a workshop held on the campus of Dartmouth College
                        during the summer of 1956. Those who attended would become the leaders of AI research for
                        decades. Many of them predicted that a machine as intelligent as a human being would exist in no
                        more than a generation and they were given millions of dollars to make this vision come true.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Eventually, it became obvious that they had grossly underestimated the difficulty of the
                        project. In 1973, in response to the criticism from James Lighthill and ongoing pressure from
                        congress, the U.S. and British Governments stopped funding undirected research into artificial
                        intelligence, and the difficult years that followed would later be known as an "AI winter".
                        Seven years later, a visionary initiative by the Japanese Government inspired governments and
                        industry to provide AI with billions of dollars, but by the late 80s the investors became
                        disillusioned and withdrew funding again.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Investment and interest in AI boomed in the first decades of the 21st century, when machine
                        learning was successfully applied to many problems in academia and industry due to new methods,
                        the application of powerful computer hardware, and the collection of immense data sets.

                        <h4>Creating New Jobs</h4>
                        <br>

                        “Artificial intelligence will change the workforce,” affirms Carolyn Frantz, Microsoft’s
                        Corporate Secretary. The bleak view of AI as a job killer is but one side of the coin: while 75
                        million jobs may disappear, as many as 133 million more engaging, less repetitive new roles are
                        expected to be created. AI “is an opportunity for workers to focus on the parts of their jobs
                        that may also be the most satisfying to them,” says Frantz.

                        <h4>Bridging Language Divides</h4>
                        <br>

                        Whether it’s teaching new languages in a personalized way or translating speech and text in
                        real-time, AI-powered language tools from Duolingo to Skype are bridging social and cultural
                        divides in our workplaces, classrooms and everyday lives. Digital translation services are not
                        “perfect,” admits Microsoft education leader Mark Sparvell, but “they offer a means of
                        understanding” that might not otherwise be possible.

                        <b>Transforming Government</b>
                        <br>

                        Less paperwork, quicker responses, a more efficient bureaucracy – AI has the power to
                        drastically change public administration, but are governments ready? This tech comes with both
                        risks and opportunities that need to be understood and evaluated. Academic Kevin Desouza
                        believes gamification and role-playing could be the key to public servants analyzing complex
                        cases, coming up with better solutions, and truly understanding the future of autonomous
                        systems.

                        <br>

                        AI has the potential to make health care “much more accessible and more affordable,” insists
                        Paul Bates, director of NHS services at Babylon Health. Babylon, an app that offers symptom
                        checking and fast access to physicians if needed, is providing advice to more than one million
                        residents in central London through an AI-powered chatbot. Patients can get an accurate, safe,

                        Other examples of machines with artificial intelligence include computers that play chess and
                        self-driving cars. Each of these machines must weigh the consequences of any action they take,
                        as each action will impact the end result. In chess, the end result is winning the game. For
                        self-driving cars, the computer system must account for all external data and compute it to act
                        in a way that prevents a collision.

                        Artificial intelligence also has applications in the financial industry, where it is used to
                        detect and flag activity in banking and finance such as unusual debit card usage and large
                        account deposits—all of which help a bank's fraud department. Applications for AI are also being
                        used to help streamline and make trading easier. This is done by making supply, demand, and
                        pricing of securities easier to estimate.

                <p><em>
                        Artificial intelligence can be divided into two different categories: weak and strong. Weak
                        artificial intelligence embodies a system designed to carry out one particular job. Weak AI
                        systems include video games such as the chess example from above and personal assistants such as
                        Amazon's Alexa and Apple's Siri. You ask the assistant a question, it answers it for you.

                        <br>
                        <br>

                        Strong artificial intelligence systems are systems that carry on the tasks considered to be
                        human-like. These tend to be more complex and complicated systems. They are programmed to handle
                        situations in which they may be required to problem solve without having a person intervene.
                        These kinds of systems can be found in applications like self-driving cars or in hospital
                        operating rooms.

                </div>

                <p style="margin: 20;"><em>
                        Since its beginning, artificial intelligence has come under scrutiny from scientists and the
                        public alike. One common theme is the idea that machines will become so highly developed that
                        humans will not be able to keep up and they will take off on their own, redesigning themselves
                        at an exponential rate.

                        <br>
                        <br>

                        Another is that machines can hack into people's privacy and even be weaponized. Other arguments
                        debate the ethics of artificial intelligence and whether intelligent systems such as robots
                        should be treated with the same rights as humans.

                        <br>
                        <br>

                        Self-driving cars have been fairly controversial as their machines tend to be designed for the
                        lowest possible risk and the least casualties. If presented with a scenario of colliding with
                        one person or another at the same time, these cars would calculate the option that would cause
                        the least amount of damage.

                        <br>
                        <br>

                        Another contentious issue many people have with artificial intelligence is how it may affect
                        human employment. With many industries looking to automate certain jobs through the use of
                        intelligent machinery, there is a concern that people would be pushed out of the workforce.
                        Self-driving cars may remove the need for taxis and car-share programs, while manufacturers may
                        easily replace human labor with machines, making people's skills more obsolete.
